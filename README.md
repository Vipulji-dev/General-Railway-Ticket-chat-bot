# General-Railway-Ticket-chat-bot
I developed a General Railway Ticket Chatbot that collects user details like name, age, gender, source, and destination to generate a ticket. It interacts conversationally, simulating a real booking process. This project highlights my skills in chatbot development, user input handling, and building interactive web applications
